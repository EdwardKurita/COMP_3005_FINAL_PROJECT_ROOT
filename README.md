COMP 3005 Final Project
=
## Configuring the PostgreSQL Database
The program looks for a database called "comp_3005_final_project" on port 5433. There must be a database setup that follows these protocols exactly otherwise the project will not run.

After the database is setup, run the DDL.sql file and DML.sql in the query tool in PGadmin. This will setup the tables and populate with fake data.

Pull the app directory and open with intellij to run the program. No further setup is required.
